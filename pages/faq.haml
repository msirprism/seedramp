      %h1 How does it work?
      %p
        You schedule an interview.
        You pitch, we ask and discuss.
        Then we either give you a check or explain
        why not.
        We video record the entire session and
        publish it <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcB3-zxKmcsUbBbwvWduZ5A">online</a>.
        You will have to sign this
        <a href="consent.html">consent form</a> before we start talking.
      %p
        We don't care what you do with the money.
        We don't sit on your board and we don't control you.
      %p
        You may come back to us for more money
        in a month, not earlier. Also, if we reject you,
        don't hesitate to come back in a month.

      %h1 Can we skip the video?
      %p
        Nope. Video is an important part of our business model
        and marketing strategy. We're not only giving you money,
        but also trying to teach everyone else.
      %p
        If your startup is doing something secret and you don't
        want to disclose some idea, don't. We don't really care
        about the idea. We care about you and your ability
        to implement something.

      %h1 Can we interview via Skype?
      %p
        At the moment, we're only doing interviews
        in Palo Alto. You have to be physically present.
        We're planning to start online interviews in April 2016.
        You can
        %a{:href=>"/schedule.html"} schedule one
        right now.

      %h1 What is the interview format?
      %p
        It takes less than an hour. In the first 15 minutes, you explain
        what you have and what you're looking for. Then for about 20
        minutes, we ask questions and discuss. For the next 15 minutes,
        we will try to explain why you and/or your ideas suck. If we fail, you
        get a check.

      %h1 What are your investment criteria?
      %p
        We don't have any specific criteria, besides common sense. To understand
        you and your business idea more, we will ask the following questions:
      %ul
        %li What is your background?
        %li How does your product or idea work, technically?
        %li Who are your competitors?
        %li What is your strategy to win against them?
        %li What do you need money for, specifically?
        %li Who is on your team?
        %li Who has already invested in this?
        %li What are the plans for future investments?
        %li What risks do you see for yourself?
