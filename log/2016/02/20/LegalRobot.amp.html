        <p><strong>Intro</strong>.
        This was our 10th interview and I was very skeptical. To be honest,
        I even forgot about it, but Dan emailed me just a few hours before the
        appointment. It was a Saturday morning at 10am. I told Dan that previous
        interviews were not successful and he had to be ready for a negative answer.
        He said no problem, at least some feedback would be helpful. With that far from optimistic
        mood, we started.</p>
        
        <div style="width:50%;float:right;z-index:100;margin-left:1em;">
          <div class="film">
            <iframe class="video" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/AetgrIGCrSU?controls=2" allowfullscreen="">&#x200B;</iframe>
          </div>

        <p><strong>Product</strong>.
        <a href="http://www.legalrobot.com">LegalRobot</a> is a hosted software solution for parsing legal documents
        and finding abnormalities within them. That's how I understood it, at least. You can
        upload a PDF contract and in a few seconds get a summary of what
        looks suspicious. For example, "clause 8.3 is too much against the buyer."
        The software contains a machine learning engine that basically compares
        a huge amount of similar documents with the one you uploaded. The smarter
        the engine, the more accurate the answers.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Market</strong>.
        The product is already on the market, if Dan was telling the truth. There
        are a few beta-users already uploading some documents there and trying to
        use the system. Moreover, there are over 300 subscribers who expressed
        their interest in the system. I doubt that even 10% of them will become
        real clients, but it's very important to see that Dan is focused on
        bringing his product to users.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Competition</strong>.
        There are a few companies that are technically doing the exact same thing. However,
        according to Dan, they are all focused on lawyers. Their target users
        are attorneys, while <a href="http://www.legalrobot.com">LegalRobot</a>
        is for those who want to do those verifications
        without paying legal fees. I truly believe that taking lawyers out of the
        market as much as possible, and replacing them with computer systems, is
        definitely the right strategy.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Team</strong>.
        <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/danrubins">Dan</a>
        is a CEO, an architect and a programmer. I was glad to see that.
        In general, I believe in startups managed and founded by technical people,
        who are real authors of their products. There are a few freelancers helping
        him. That's exactly the type of startup team I'm comfortable investing in.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Cash</strong>.
        Dan put his own money into this and someone else also added $25,000 a few
        months ago. His burn rate is around $3,000 per month, which sounds very
        reasonable. He basically spends most of this money paying his own bills.
        That's a perfect tactic for a young startup, I believe. He is
        planning to raise seed or series A money in a few months and needs
        cash to survive until then. He asked for $20,000 but I offered him $5,000
        for the next calendar month. If things go well, the product
        will be ready for a demo (it wasn't during the interview) and beta-users will produce
        some traction. He may come back to us again and we'll invest another portion
        of cash to cover the next calendar month.</p>
        
        <p>On Monday, Dan emailed me the contract, we signed it electronically, and I've
        sent him a wire transfer for $5,000. We're partners!</p>
