      <h1>First $5,000 for LegalRobot</h1>
      <div id="content">
        <p><strong>Intro</strong>. This was our 10th interview and I was very skeptical. To be honest, I even forgot about it, but Dan emailed me just a few hours before the appointment. It was a Saturday morning at 10am. I told Dan that previous interviews were not successful and he had to be ready for a negative answer. He said no problem, at least some feedback would be helpful. With that far from optimistic mood, we started.</p>

        <p><strong>Product</strong>. <a href="http://www.legalrobot.com">LegalRobot</a> is a hosted software solution for parsing legal documents and finding abnormalities within them. That's how I understood it, at least. You can upload a PDF contract and in a few seconds get a summary of what looks suspicious. For example, clause 8.3 is too much against the buyer. The software contains a machine learning engine that basically compares a huge amount of similar documents with the one you uploaded. The smarter the engine, the more accurate the answers.</p>
        <p><strong>Market</strong>. The product is already on the market, if Dan was telling the truth. There are a few beta-users already uploading some documents there and trying to use the system. Moreover, there are over 300 subscribers who expressed their interest in the system. I doubt that even 10% of them will become real clients, but it's very important to see that Dan is focused on bringing his product to users.</p>
        <p><strong>Competition</strong>. There are a few companies that are technically doing the exact same thing. However, according to Dan, they are all focused on lawyers. Their target users are attorneys, while <a href="http://www.legalrobot.com">LegalRobot</a> is for those who want to do those verifications without paying legal fees. I truly believe that taking lawyers out of the market as much as possible, and replacing them with computer systems, is definitely the right strategy.</p>
        <p><strong>Team</strong>. <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/danrubins">Dan</a> is a CEO, an architect and a programmer. I was glad to see that. In general, I believe in startups managed and founded by technical people, who are real authors of their products. There are a few freelancers helping him. That's exactly the type of startup team I'm comfortable investing in.</p>
        <p><strong>Cash</strong>. Dan put his own money into this and someone else also added $25,000 a few months ago. His burn rate is around $3,000 per month, which sounds very reasonable. He basically spends most of this money paying his own bills. That's a perfect tactic for a young startup, I believe. He is planning to raise seed or series A money in a few months and needs cash to survive until then. He asked for $20,000 but I offered him $5,000 for the next calendar month. If things go well, the product will be ready for a demo (it wasn't during the interview) and beta-users will produce some traction. He may come back to us again and we'll invest another portion of cash to cover the next calendar month.</p>
        <p>On Monday, Dan emailed me the contract, we signed it electronically, and I've sent him a wire transfer for $5,000. We're partners!</p>
